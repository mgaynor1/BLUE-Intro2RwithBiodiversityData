# General Information

## Prerequisites  
-   Basics in file management and familiarity with data sheets (in Microsoft Excel, Google sheets, etc.)
  
## Learning objective  

------------

>     
> * Be able to navigate R Studio and write reproducible code.    
> * Execute lines of code, as well as complete scripts.      
> * Identify variables, functions, and operators.     
> * Approach basic troubleshooting.     
> * Know how to download biodiversity data using Application Programming Interfacen (API).  
>

------------


## Introduction {#intro}
Students will learn R basics while downloading biodiversity data from multiple data repositories. This module will walk students through installing R, navigating R,writing reproducible scripts in R, and using R to download biodiversity data.

## Why R?

-   R is a popular scripting language with readily available jobs (see jobs here: [r-users.com](https://www.r-users.com/))

-   R allows for reproducibility

    -   Every step is documented by each line of code in an analysis.

-   R is free and open access

    -   there is no associated cost üí≤
    -   lots of community support for writing and troubleshooting code (ex. [Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/))

-   R is interdisciplinary

-   R can create beautiful figures
